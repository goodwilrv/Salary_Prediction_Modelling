# Salary_Prediction_Modelling
Modelling a salary prediction

This project  does the basic EDA, feature engineering and final modelling for predicting salary based on some explanatory variables.

Here I have used 3 boosting models XGBoost, Light BGM and CatBoost. And I have created a stacked ensemeble from prediction of these models to create the final predictions.
